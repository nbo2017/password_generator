# Password Generator
This is a simple GUI password generator developed in Python 3 and Kivy framework. This firmware relies on the secrets.py module to generate a criptographically safe password for the user. 
The user is allowed to set which type of characters (uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters) will be included in the password, as well as the amount of passwords to be generated.
